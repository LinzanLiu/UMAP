# Scripts to compute distances between centroids

- Distances.py : Use this for computing the bootstrapped values per study day. 

- imageToGIF.py : Convert specific images to a GIF

- centroids_perTreatment.py : Compute centroids of the conditions using np.mean() function.
  
  NOTE: More elegant and practical script will be released soon
  
- meanDistances_perTreatment.py : Find distances of treatments' OR, OD, and CON to HC and compute mean of these values.

  NOTE: More elegant and practical script will be released soon

- find_diValue.py : Find discrimination index of a specific ratxdayxtrial(e.g. Rat1 OR Trial1)
